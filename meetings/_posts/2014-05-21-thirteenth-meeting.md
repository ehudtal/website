We'll be having meeting number 13 (dun dun dun) this Sunday at the usual cafe. Come whether you want to see the hardware involved or whether you're just interested in the movement. All are welcome!

__Please check the lower section of the cafe! There are stairs that go down behind the counter where you order your coffee.__
