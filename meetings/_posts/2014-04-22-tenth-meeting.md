Spring is around the corner, which we all know means one thing: meshnets. We'll be having our tenth meeting at our favorite Lower East Side cafe.

With warm weather finally making an appearance, we'll be focusing on getting nodes up around the boroughs. Come by if you're interested in any capacity.

__Please check the lower section of the cafe! There are stairs that go down behind the counter where you order your coffee.__
