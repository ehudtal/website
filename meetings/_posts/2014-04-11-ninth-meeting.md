Our next meeting will be on Tuesday, April 15th. [xCubicle](http://www.xcubicle.com/), the Lower East Side's
own hackerspace, has kindly agreed to host a meeting for a second time. If you plan to come, please RSVP on
this [Uniiverse page](http://uv.rs/1g0SD4w). If you share the event on Facebook
or Twitter, the $5 RSVP fee will be waived. (For those worried, you can target the appropriate 
friends on Facebook before it gets shared.)

If you want to come and see what we're up to or you're just curious about meshnets
in general, stop by! We're a friendly bunch, I promise.
