Join us __downstairs__ at the caf√© this Sunday. Our mesh needs to have a local server that can provide information for the community, especially during power outages or internet disruption. We already have a solar powered server running adjacent to one node. We need to choose the software and configure it to be available over the mesh. Ideas include , chat software, emergency help, maps, and an offline copy of Wikipedia.

We will also be discussing further changes to this website.

__Please check the lower section of the cafe! There are stairs that go down behind the counter where you order your coffee.__

Please join [our meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/nycmesh/).
