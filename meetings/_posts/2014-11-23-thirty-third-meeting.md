Join us __downstairs__ at the caf√© this Sunday as we plan the next steps in our journey to setup an experimental mesh network. After last week's successful installations we need to plan how to connect more nodes and make public access points (APs). What should our AP welcome screen say? What captive portal software to use? Community web page? Solar powered rooftop server? etc.

__Please check the lower section of the cafe! There are stairs that go down behind the counter where you order your coffee.__

Please join [our meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/nycmesh/).
