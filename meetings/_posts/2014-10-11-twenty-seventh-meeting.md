[Introduction to Mesh Networks](http://utopiaschool.org/node/123)

This Saturday, #nycmeshnet will be going to Utopia School's Introduction to Mesh Networks: Access to the Internet for the majority of the public, is controlled by a select few organizations. Mesh networks are an alternative to the current centralized topology. We will explain the basic concepts behind mesh networks and how they are different from traditional computer networks as well as the specific technical requirements.
