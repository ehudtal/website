[The Utopia School Practical Mesh Workshop](http://www.meetup.com/nycmesh/events/213631142/)


[The practical mesh workshop](http://utopiaschool.org/node/125) is the third and last of Utopia School's mesh classes. #nycmeshnet will be going to this.

One of the widely accepted goals of mesh networks is for everyone to be able to participate equally with commodity hardware and software, however things are not so simple yet. This workshop will guide participants through the process of setting up the hardware and software necessary to operate a node in a cjdns wireless mesh network. By the end we will hopefully have a functioning experimental network and a bunch of ideas about how to make the process simpler!
