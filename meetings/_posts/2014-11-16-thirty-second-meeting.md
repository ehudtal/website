We now have enough potential nodes in the east village and lower east side to form some kind of backbone for a mesh. We're going to meet at a member's apartment with our routers, check that we are properly configured, and then visit other member's rooftops and see if we can connect.

If you're unable to locate the place, send an email to brian@nycmesh.net and we'll find you.
