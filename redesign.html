  A Free as in Freedom network owned and operated by our community

<h2>What is Mesh</h2>
<p>Mesh is a network were all nodes cooperate in the distribution of data. Nodes are WiFi routers spread across the city. A mesh network has no central server and no single internet service provider.</p>
<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>We aim to create a free, resilient, stand-alone communication system that serves both for daily use and also for emergencies—be it power outages and internet disruption—running software that helps our community with hyperlocal maps and events.
